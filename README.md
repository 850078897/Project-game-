## Big Picture

I write a project about a person who wants to escape from a hospital. There are three types of people. They are Diuren Ma, Luben Wei, and zombies. You have 2 choice for each section. Every decision is a modification of story elements so you have to be careful. Enjoy it!
Ps: do not pity 
This project did not use any functions for coding therefore we can use functions to code each one. Then we are able to return to the step before. Because of it is a project about a person who wants to escape from a hospital, we can use some horrible produces for each step we choiced. Thus this project will have more fun.

## First Round
Now you have to be brought into the game environment. Any decision could lead to the end of the game.

## Test plan for first round
Right answer: 1(Chasing the boy), 1(Show kindness to the boy, but keep a certain distance), 2(Go back to the corridor, find the fire axe, and find a convenient and hidden room), 1(Pick up the boyâ€™s pistol and run, even if he's still useful to you), 1(Sneak). YOU WIN

## Reelections and revisions
