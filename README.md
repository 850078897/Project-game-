**Big Picture

I write a project about a person who wants to escape from a hospital. There are three types of people. They are Diuren Ma, Luben Wei, and zombies. You have 2 choices for each section. Every decision is a modification of story elements so you have to be careful. Enjoy it! Ps: do not pity This project did not use any functions for coding therefore we can use functions to code each one. Then we are able to return to the step before. Because of it is a project about a person who wants to escape from a hospital, we can use some horrible produces choices for each step.. Thus this project will have more fun.
**First Round

Now you have to be brought into the game environment. Any decision could lead to the end of the game.
The program will ask you what choice for each step.
If you choose the right move, you are able to continue to the next step until .
If you choose the wrong move, the result is game over. Do not worry about that. The program will give you have the chance the do it again.
**Test plan for first round
Right answer: 1(Chasing the boy), 1(Show kindness to the boy, but keep a certain distance), 2(Go back to the corridor, find the fire axe, and find a convenient and hidden room) 1(Pick up the boyâ€™s pistol and run, even if he's still useful to you), 1(Sneak). YOU WIN

**Reflections and revisions
There is a better way that put each plot in functions so we are able to go back if we choose wrong choice.

**Next steps

Create background and pictures by using pygame.
The pictures are able to change when the player type the answers.
